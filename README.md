C and C++
Here is a breif history of C and C++ and a few examples of how they can be used in digital arts:

C was designed by Dennis Ritchie as a successor to the B programming language, and it was first released in 1972. As computers began to adopt C compilers, the language gained popularity. C was also developed alongside UNIX operating systems. Over the years, there have been extensions and new versions of the language, including K&R C, ANSI C, and ISO C, among others. File extensions for C are .c (program files) and .h (header files).

C++ also incorporates object-oriented programming (OOP) in addition to the features of C. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup and was first released in 1985. C code can also run in C++. it has more files extensions like .cpp and .hpp. 

Both C and C++ are considered low-level languages and are used for tasks that require fast processing. C compiles directly to machine code with minimal overhead, making it preferred for embedded systems. C++ is well-suited for applications that need to run quickly, such as browsers, operating systems, and games.

Both C and C++ are compiled languages, meaning they require a compiler to convert the code you write into machine-readable object code, allowing the machine to execute instructions. This process translates human-readable code into machine code.

C is used in many operating systems, databases, web servers, and embedded systems because of its ability to directly allocate memory and its control over computer architecture through communication with the hardware. C++ is commonly used in app development, embedded systems, and high-performance computation, especially when working with limited resources. Its ability to interact directly with hardware makes it ideal for applications requiring fast execution speeds and efficient memory management.

C is one of the first modern programming languages and allows direct access to a computer's hardware, making it particularly useful for understanding both programming and how computers work. Many modern programming languages today were initially developed using C as a foundation.

C++ is unique because it supports dynamic memory allocation, allowing memory to be opened or "freed" at any time, even during runtime.

C is derived from B, which in turn came from the Combined Programming Language (CPL). Neither B nor CPL is in use today, and both are considered almost extinct. C++ is derived from C and extends it, with C still being widely used.

If you're called upon to repair or work with an artwork written in these languages, here are some sources you could use to learn how to read the code: C Documentation, The C Programming Language (2nd edition) by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie, For C++, you can check ISO C++ and other online resources like Stack Overflow.

Any artwork that requires handling a lot of tasks at once can rely on C and C++. Video games, for example, are heavily developed using C++ due to the significant processing power required. Any art work that takes in live feed and then turns into an art piece can be good for the processing power it might require.
